              A project description is a high-level overview of why you’re doing
              a project. The document explains a project’s objectives and its
              essential qualities. Think of it as the elevator pitch that
              focuses on what and why without delving into how. You typically
              draft a project description early on, during the project
              initiation phase of the project management lifecycle. The project
              manager often writes the project description. However, if you are
              working for an agency that seeks grant funding or writing a
              research proposal, you might need to learn how to write a project
              description in a project proposal.
